(defsection @mgl-opt (:title "Gradient Based Optimization")
  "We have a real valued, differentiable function F and the task is to
  find the parameters that minimize its value. Optimization starts
  from a single point in the parameter space of F, and this single
  point is updated iteratively based on the gradient and value of F at
  or around the current point.

  Note that while the stated problem is that of global optimization,
  for non-convex functions, most algorithms will tend to converge to a
  local optimum.

  Currently, there are two optimization algorithms:
  MGL-GD::@MGL-GD (with several variants) and MGL-CG::@MGL-CG both of
  which are first order methods (they do not need second order
  gradients) but more can be added with the @MGL-OPT-EXTENSION-API."
