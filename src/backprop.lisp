  "Backpropagation Neural Networks are just functions with lots of
  parameters called _weights_ and a layered structure when presented
  as a [computational
  graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation). The
  network is trained to MINIMIZE some kind of _loss function_ whose
  value the network computes.

  In this implementation, a [BPN][class] is assembled from several
  `LUMP`s (roughly corresponding to layers). Both feed-forward and
  recurrent neural nets are supported (FNN and RNN, respectively).
  `BPN`s can contain not only `LUMP`s but other `BPN`s, too. As we
  see, networks are composite objects and the abstract base class for
  composite and simple parts is called CLUMP."
  (clump class)
  "At this point, you may want to jump ahead to get a feel for how
  things work by reading the @MGL-FNN-TUTORIAL.")

;;; Everything is defined with DEFCLASS-NOW because DEFMAKER needs the
;;; class to be around at macro expansion time.

  (:documentation "A CLUMP is a LUMP or a [BPN][class]. It represents
  a differentiable function. Arguments of clumps are given during
  instantiation. Some arguments are clumps themselves so they get
  permenantly wired together like this:

  ```commonlisp
  (->v*m (->input :size 10 :name 'input)
         (->weight :dimensions '(10 20) :name 'weight)
         :name 'activation)
  ```

  The above creates three clumps: the vector-matrix multiplication
  clumps called `ACTIVATION` which has a reference to its operands:
  INPUT and WEIGHT. Note that the example just defines a function, no
  actual computation has taken place, yet.

  This wiring of `CLUMP`s is how one builds feed-forward nets (FNN) or
  recurrent neural networks (RNN) that are `CLUMP`s themselves so one
  can build nets in a hiearchical style if desired. Non-composite
  `CLUMP`s are called LUMP (note the loss of `C` that stands for
  composite). The various LUMP subtypes correspond to different layer
  types (->SIGMOID, ->DROPOUT, ->RELU, ->TANH, etc)."))

  the same result for each instance in a batch. These clumps are the
  weights, the parameters of the network. STRIPEDP returns true iff
  CLUMP does not represent weights (i.e. it's not a ->WEIGHT).

  For striped clumps, their NODES and DERIVATIVES are MAT objects with
  a leading dimension (number of rows in the 2d case) equal to the
  number of instances in the batch. Non-striped clumps have no

  represented by CLUMP and add them to DERIVATIVES of the
  corresponding argument clumps. The DERIVATIVES of CLUMP contains the
  sum of partial derivatives of all clumps by the corresponding
  output. This function is intended to be called after a FORWARD pass.

  Take the ->SIGMOID clump for example when the network is being
  applied to a batch of two instances `x1` and `x2`. `x1` and `x2` are
  set in the ->INPUT lump X. The sigmoid computes `1/(1+exp(-x))`
  where `X` is its only argument clump.

      f(x) = 1/(1+exp(-x))

  When BACKWARD is called on the sigmoid lump, its DERIVATIVES is a
  2x1 MAT object that contains the partial derivatives of the loss
  function:

      dL(x1)/df
      dL(x2)/df

  Now the BACKWARD method of the sigmoid needs to add `dL(x1)/dx1` and
  `dL(x2)/dx2` to DERIVATIVES of `X`. Now, `dL(x1)/dx1 = dL(x1)/df *
  df(x1)/dx1` and the first term is what we have in DERIVATIVES of the
  sigmoid so it only needs to calculate the second term."))

  "Return the index of the BPN in CLUMPS of RNN whose task it is to
  execute computation at `(- (TIME-STEP RNN) LAG)`. This is normally
  the same as TIME-STEP (disregarding LAG). That is, CLUMPS can be
  indexed by TIME-STEP to get the BPN. However, when *WARP-TIME* is
  true, execution proceeds in a cycle as the structure of the network
  allows.

  Suppose we have a typical RNN that only ever references the previous
  time step so its MAX-LAG is 1. Its UNFOLDER returns `BPN`s of
  identical structure bar a shift in their time lagged connections
  except for the very first, so WARP-START and WARP-LENGTH are both 1.
  If *WARP-TIME* is NIL, then the mapping from TIME-STEP to the BPN in
  CLUMPS is straightforward:

      time:   |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5
      --------+----+----+----+----+----+----
      warped: |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5
      --------+----+----+----+----+----+----
      bpn:    | b0 | b1 | b2 | b3 | b4 | b5

  When *WARP-TIME* is true, we reuse the `B1` - `B2` bpns in a loop:

      time:   |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5
      --------+----+----+----+----+----+----
      warped: |  0 |  1 |  2 |  1 |  2 |  1
      --------+----+----+----+----+----+----
      bpn:    | b0 | b1 | b2 | b1*| b2 | b1*

  `B1*` is the same BPN as `B1`, but its connections created by LAG go
  through warped time and end up referencing `B2`. This way, memory
  consumption is independent of the number time steps needed to
  process a sequence or make predictions.

  To be able to pull this trick off WARP-START and WARP-LENGTH must be
  specified when the RNN is instantiated. In general, with
  *WARP-TIME* `(+ WARP-START (MAX 2 WARP-LENGTH))` bpns are needed.
  The 2 comes from the fact that with cycle length 1 a bpn would need
  to takes its input from itself which is problematic because it has
  NODES for only one set of values."
