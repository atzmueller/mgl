  that's when applied to an element of TRUTHS returns a sequence
  representing some kind of discrete target distribution (P in the
  definition below). TRUTH-KEY may be NIL which is equivalent to the
  IDENTITY function. PREDICTION-KEY is the same kind of key for
  PREDICTIONS, but the sequence it returns represents a distribution
  that approximates (Q below) the true one.

  Cross-entropy of the true and approximating distributions is defined
  as:

      cross-entropy(p,q) = - sum_i p(i) * log(q(i))

  of which this function returns the sum over the pairs of elements of
  TRUTHS and PREDICTIONS keyed by TRUTH-KEY and PREDICTION-KEY.

  Due to the logarithm, if q(i) is close to zero, we run into
  numerical problems. To prevent this, all q(i) that are less than
  MIN-PREDICTION-PR are treated as if they were MIN-PREDICTION-PR.

  The second value returned is the sum of p(i) over all TRUTHS and all
  `I`. This is normally equal to `(LENGTH TRUTHS)`, since elements of
  TRUTHS represent a probability distribution, but this is not
  enforced which allows relative importance of elements to be
  controlled.

  The third value returned is a plist that maps each index occurring
  in the distribution sequences to a list of two elements:

       sum_j p_j(i) * log(q_j(i))

      sum_j p_j(i)
