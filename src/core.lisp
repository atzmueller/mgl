(defsection @mgl-model-stripe (:title "Batch Processing")
  "Processing instances one by one during training or prediction can
  be slow. The models that support batch processing for greater
  efficiency are said to be _striped_.

  Typically, during or after creating a model, one sets MAX-N-STRIPES
  on it a positive integer. When a batch of instances is to be fed to
  the model it is first broken into subbatches of length that's at
  most MAX-N-STRIPES. For each subbatch, SET-INPUT (FIXDOC) is called
  and a before method takes care of setting N-STRIPES to the actual
  number of instances in the subbatch. When MAX-N-STRIPES is set
  internal data structures may be resized which is an expensive
  operation. Setting N-STRIPES is a comparatively cheap operation,
  often implemented as matrix reshaping.

  Note that for models made of different parts (for example,
  [MGL-BP:BPN][CLASS] consists of [MGL-BP:LUMP][]s) , setting these
  values affects the constituent parts, but one should never change
  the number stripes of the parts directly because that would lead to
  an internal inconsistency in the model."

  Some objects conflate function and call: the forward pass of a
  [MGL-BP:BPN][class] computes output from inputs so it is like a
  function but it also doubles as a function call in the sense that
  the bpn (function) object changes state during the computation of
  the output. Hence not even the forward pass of a bpn is thread safe.
  There is also the restriction that all inputs must be of the same
  size.

  For example, if we have a function that builds bpn a for an input of
  a certain size, then we can create a factory that creates bpns for a
  particular call. The factory probably wants to keep the weights the
  same though. In @MGL-PARAMETERIZED-EXECUTOR-CACHE,
  MAKE-EXECUTOR-WITH-PARAMETERS is this factory.

  Parallelization of execution is another possibility
  MAP-OVER-EXECUTORS allows, but there is no prebuilt solution for it,
